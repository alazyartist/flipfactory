				Flip Factory is the future home of the metaversesâ€™ most complex emotes.
				Largely comprised of the Tricking move set and eventually extending into
				other movement arts based talents, we aim to deliver the best motion
				capture animations available across any digital universe.
				<br /> Flip Factory is offering exclusive access and membership of its
				products and services to holders of a FF Employee ID Card, the first NFT
				offered by Flip Factory. Anyone who holds an Employee ID will be awarded
				1 free-to-claim emote when the Emote Machine1.0 goes online, and have
				access to earn unlimited emotes for free through various protocols
				developed by the team.
				<br /> All emote NFTs come with full commercial rights, as well as
				digital files ready for export and use by anyone who also holds an
				Employee ID and licensee card. Both Employee ID and Emote NFTs will be
				further utilized in the game developed by the team: Scrolls of Ambu.
				Holders of an Employee ID NFT will also be given everything needed to
				play, compete, and earn in the Scrolls of Ambu game during its
				development. Our goal is to be a completely metaverse agnostic system
				that can (and will) integrate with any of the leading metaverses.
				Supporting our emotes across various platforms is core to the service we
				aim to provide, offering premier access of these services to holders of
				the Employee ID card.
