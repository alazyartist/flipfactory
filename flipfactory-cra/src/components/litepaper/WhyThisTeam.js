				Our team has been building the foundations for something like this for
				well over a year now. Our lead developer is obsessed with the movement
				arts and what the human body is capable of; specifically, the acrobatic
				art of Tricking. Because of this, he set out to create the Trickedex, a
				fully interactive 3d library of movements and the associated theory that
				is utilized by Trickers. In order to accomplish this, a library of
				motion capture footage for each of these movements is being compiled
				into the Trickedex.
				<br />
				An application like this has huge implications for onboarding new
				members into these movement communities by giving them a standard place
				to reference information from. Thousands of hours have already gone into
				this project and it is just the beginning of where it hopes to go.
				<br />
				In order to capture these movements in their highest quality we did not
				skimp out on equipment; we found out what the pros use and got the same.
				The XSens MVN Link by Movella is an industry-standard piece of motion
				capture equipment used by the likes of HBO, Amazon, Netflix, Disney,
				Marvel, and more found here â†’
