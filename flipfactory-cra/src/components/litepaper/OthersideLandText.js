				Our team has ideally located plots in the Otherside, with our best plot
				#108 sitting nicely on the main center island inside the Otherside. This
				will be the home of the Flip Factory and the entry point for the Scrolls
				of Ambu game to come.
				<br />
				<br />
				Ambu is our Koda located on #64420. Hailing from an alternate universe,
				he brings with him wisdom about the ancient art of Tricking and the
				scrolls to teach others to perform these feats.
				<br />
				<br />
				Having these plots of land be so far away will work to our advantage to
				encourage travel throughout the Otherside on your way to our other plot.
				Coming from the Flip Factory with some fresh emotes, players will be
				able to showcase their new skills all the way out to the edges of the
				metaverse in search of the Scrolls of Ambu and what comes with it.{" "}
