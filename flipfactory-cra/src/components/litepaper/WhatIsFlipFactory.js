				Flip Factory is the metaverseâ€™s first and most versatile Emote Shop.
				Allowing users to access unique movements across a variety of platforms,
				the Flip Factory always rewards the movement artist individually. The
				Factory will provide new opportunities to both movement artists and
				creators through the utilities offered in Web3, and ever expand on the
				expressive nature of movement within the digital landscape.
				<br />
				<br />
				In addition to offering new revenue models and integrating expression
				through movement into the metaverse, Flip Factory will be a central hub
				for talent-seeking industries to gravitate towards to find the perfect
				hire. Our aim is to provide new ways to license individual
				movement-based talents, and connect artists with prospective industries
				in need of their expertise.
