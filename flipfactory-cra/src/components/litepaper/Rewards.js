				Each of these emotes are created by some talented athlete somewhere. In
				the current industry, these athletes are paid for their time and that is
				the end of it. Leveraging the technology enabled by the blockchain, we
				will be able to set up a royalties system that automatically pays the
				athlete for every transaction their motion capture is used in, rewarding
				these athletes in perpetuity for their athleticism. This allows us to
				get Trickers and other movement artists paid for doing Tricks! Something
				that our team is extremely passionate about. For the last decade, we
				have watched people go beyond what was thought to be possible with the
				human body with no reward other than the accomplishment itself. We aim
				to sweeten the deal while also enabling anyone in the world to use these
				movements only a select few can actually perform.{" "}

				We intend to build several systems in which the users will be able to
				gain rewards (in the form of new emotes, wearables, and collectibles)
				through engaging with our various systems (Flip Factory, Scrolls Of
				Ambu, and other related projects). ### Proof of Flip
			</div>

			<div className='font-lucky text-2xl'>Proof of Flip</div>
			<div className='text-xs font-light'>
				One of our intentions is to implement a proof of flip mechanic, wherein
				holders of the employeeID will be able to upload video proof of them
				performing certain Tricking moves in order to “claim” these moves. Once
				claimed and approved by our system (manual at first, A.I. driven one
				day) users will be rewarded with a “Claimed Trick,” which will give them
				access to the emotes, as well as a more powerful card to play in Scrolls
				of Ambu (when it comes).{" "}
