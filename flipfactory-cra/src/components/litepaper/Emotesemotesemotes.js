				A set of movements that you can play on command to show some emotion,
				the concept of an emote is not new. It’s been permeating video games for
				a good while now. These began as simple movements like a head nod or a
				friendly wave, however over the last few years we have seen AAA games
				incorporating more interesting acrobatic movements and dances into their
				ecosystems, allowing players to have their characters perform full-on
				dance sequences and crazy high-flying tricks at the push of a button.{" "}
				<br />
				<br />
				Luckily, many of these virtual worlds are building functionality like
				this into their core for people like us to build on top of, and, “if we
				do it right” extend the functionality. This is where our first project
				the Flip Factory comes in.
				<br />
				<br /> These movements have always been limited to a few choices and
				without much variety. In the coming metaverses, people will want
				options. They will want to be able to differentiate their character’s
				movements from everyone else. In order to do that we will need a lot of
				options and ways to call on them quickly.
