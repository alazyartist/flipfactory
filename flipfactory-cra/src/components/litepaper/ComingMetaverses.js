				The future of technology is growing ever closer and it has become
				apparent that the Metaverse is what’s coming next.
				<br />
				<br /> The forums and social feeds of the past are going to be replaced
				with virtual worlds where individuals can be and do anything they want!
				No longer will we be represented by profile pictures, but by full-blown
				3D avatars that can move and embody the things we want to display.
				<br />
				<br /> These avatars will be representations of how we want the world to
				recognize us.
				<br />
				<br />
				In order to stand out from the crowds, many people will curate their
				Avatars’ styles and clothing options. What few realize is that we will
				be able to infinitely customize these avatars’ movements as well,
				bringing just a little bit more reality into the digital ecosystem.
				<br />
				<br />
				Having emotes that convey body language will be one heavily utilized
				action, but that’s only one aspect of what is possible. The various
				worlds of human movement can be brought into these digital worlds in
				ways that we’ve never seen before.
				<br />
				<br />
				There is going to be a “fight” for who becomes “THE” metaverse to go to.
				<br />
				<br />
				Currently, we have a number of contenders throwing their hats in the
				ring. Projects like, The Sandbox, Decentraland, and the Otherside are
				the main contenders going into the 3rd quarter of 2022.
				<br />
				<br /> The most promising of which seems to be the Otherside by Yuga
				Labs, the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, amongst other notable
				NFT projects under their command.
				<br />
				<br />
				In a world where ownership can be independently verified on the
				blockchain, assets will be able to follow users on their journeys
				between these various virtual worlds. <br />
				<br />
				This would allow you to always play as “YOU,” bringing any clothing or
				other attributes your character has with you from metaverse to
				metaverse. Including, if we can help it, your movements!
