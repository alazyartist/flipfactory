					The Otherside is a gamified, interoperable metaverse currently under
					development. The game blends mechanics from massively multiplayer
					online role playing games (MMORPGs) and web3-enabled virtual worlds.
					Think of it as a metaRPG where the players own the world, your NFTs
					can become playable characters, and thousands can play together in
					real time.
					<br />
					<br />
					We intend to build out our game, the Scrolls of Ambu heavily on top of
					infrastructure the Otherside creates.
